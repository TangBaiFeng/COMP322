				As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms
				and set out walking once more.
				<span class="underline"
					>I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I
					was carrying a very fragile treasure.</span
				>
				<span class="orange"
					>It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile
					on all Earth.</span
				>
				In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes,
				his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to
				myself:
				<span class="boldred"
					>"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most
					important is invisible...‚Äù</span
				>
				As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile,
				I said to myself, again:
				<span class="boldred">
					"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is
					sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower- the image of a
					rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a
					lamp, even when he is asleep. . ."
				</span>
				And I felt him to be more fragile still.
				<span class="underline">
					I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a
					flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind .
					. .
